			<div id="challenge" class="sectionbox">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Work with your partner and experiment with Jquery
						<ul> Use the JavaScript console to test all the parts of your program and see if anything went wrong
							 with new commands in the JavaScript console to see how they work</ul>
							
					</p>
			</div>

			<div id="problem" class="sectionbox">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Had issues with trying to figure out why the color wasnt changing when I had it be clickable. BUt aftr trying I realized I
						I forgot to add semicolons, and that I mispelled the names of things which made it harder. Tried doing task x but couldnt figure it out, and was running out of time </p>
			</div>

			<div id="reflection" class="sectionbox">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The assignment went well, had some bumps with my mispelling and forgetting semicolons. But it was fun learning how to make a button change the color and or them of the block.
						Definetly might be implementing this to my Final project with my group
					</p>
